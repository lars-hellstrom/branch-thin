This directory contains the simulation data used for the figures in our paper in _The American Naturalist_.

Files with `.csv` extension are in comma separated value format (without column header row). Files with `.db` extension are SQLite3 database files. Both have a common format, where the first column (named `a6e` in table `br4nches` in the `.db` files) is the full age of the simulated tree, and remaining columns g⟨ℓ⟩ are the counts of subbranches ℓ growth cycles younger than the branch being sampled; the averages of these values are thus what our function g(ℓ,n) should approximate. Files whose name begins with `wholetree` take the entire (simulated) tree as one sample, whereas those whose name begins with `branches` take each (again simulated) branch of a given age as a separate sample; that is why the latter are much larger (trees have _a lot_ of branches).

The rest of the filenames encode the parameter values and growth method used in the simulation. For `branches` the order of parameters is µ-ß-d-p. For `wholetree-rgrow` the order is ß-d-p, whereas µ is random for each bud (at a distribution of 20%/60%/20% between values 1, 2, and 3); the same random µ distribution is used for `wholetree-random`, whereas it is µ=2 for `wholetree-fixed`. Remaining parameters for `wholetree-fixed` and `wholetree-random` are in order ß-d-p-q.
